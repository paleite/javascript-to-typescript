# javascript-to-typescript

This script will migrate your repository from JavaScript to TypeScript.

## Migrate

From the command line, navigate to the directory where your JavaScript repository is located. You can pass a source directory as an argument to the script (recommended).

Example:

```sh
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/paleite/javascript-to-typescript/master/js2ts.sh)" -- src/
```
